# **WildSearch**

The project aims to build a robust search system that leverages the strengths of both BM25 and Vector Search. The hybrid search system provides nuanced, comprehensive search results, ideal for working with complex and varied datasets.

# Search System
BM25 Search
BM25 is a sophisticated ranking function used in information retrieval. It operates like an efficient librarian, excelling at navigating through extensive collections of documents by evaluating the frequency of search terms in each document.

Vector Search
Vector Search extends search capabilities beyond mere keyword matching by incorporating semantic understanding. It interprets the context and meaning behind search queries, providing results that align with the intended meaning rather than just keyword matches.

Hybrid Search Approach
Our hybrid search system synergizes BM25's keyword-focused precision with Vector Search's semantic understanding. This approach delivers nuanced, comprehensive search results, making it ideal for complex and varied datasets.
